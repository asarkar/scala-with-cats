  7.3.3.1 Exercise: Adding All The Things
  The cutting edge SuperAdder v3.5a-32 is the world's first choice for adding together numbers.

  SuperAdder's market share continues to grow, and now there is demand for additional functionality.
  People now want to add List[Option[Int]]. Change add so this is possible. The SuperAdder code base
  is of the highest quality, so make sure there is no code duplication!
