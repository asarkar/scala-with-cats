/*
4.10.1 Exercise: Branching out Further with Monads

Let's write a Monad for the Tree data type given below.

Verify that the code works on instances of Branch and Leaf,
and that the Monad provides Functor-like behaviour for free.

Also verify that having a Monad in scope allows us to use for comprehensions,
despite the fact that we havenâ€™t directly implemented flatMap or map on Tree.

Don't feel you have to make tailRecM tail-recursive. Doing so is quite difficult.
